	Subramaniyan's father wanted him to learn English and Maths and become an engineer.<br>[4] From a young age, Subramaniyan was inclined towards music and poetry. <br>At the age of 11, he was given the title of "Bharathi" (meaning blessed by the goddess of learning Saraswati) for his excellence in poetry. In<mark> 1897</mark>, <br>at the age of 15, he married Chellamma, who was then seven years old.<br> His father died when he was sixteen.[3] After the death of his father, <br><mark>he wrote a letter to the Raja of Ettayapuram</mark>, requesting for financial assistance. <br>He was granted a job in the court of Ettayapuram, which he left after a while and went to Varanasi.<br> During his stay in Varanasi, he was exposed to Hindu spirituality and nationalism and learned new languages such as Sanskrit, <br>Hindi and English. He also changed his outward appearance, <br>growing a beard and started wearing a turban.[1]

In the same year, <br>Bharathi joined as an assistant editor at Swadesamitran, a Tamil daily.[1] In <mark>December 1905</mark>,<br> he attended a session of Indian National Congress in Varanasi. <br>On his journey back home, he met Sister Nivedita, who was Swami Vivekananda's spiritual heir.<br> She inspired Bharathi to recognize the rights and privilege of women.<br>[1] Bharathi considered her as a embodiment of Hindu goddess Shakti and considered Nivedita as his Guru. <br>He later attended the Indian National Congress session in Calcutta held under Dadabhai Naoroji, <br>which demanded Swaraj and boycott of British goods.[4]</p>

	<h2><u><i>Literary work</i></u></h2>	
	<p>Bharathi was one of the pioneers of modern Tamil literature.<br>[10] He is known by the nickname "Mahakavi" ("The Great Poet").[11] Bharathi used simple words and rhythms, <br>unlike the previous century works in Tamil, which had complex vocabulary.<br> He also proposed novel ideas and techniques in his poems.<br> He used a metre called Nondi Chindu in most of his works,<br> which was earlier used by Gopalakrisnha Bharathiar.[12]

Bharathi's poetry expressed progressive and reformist ideals. <br>His poetry was a forerunner to modern Tamil poetry in different aspects and combined classical and contemporary elements.<br> He penned thousands of verses on diverse topics like Indian Nationalism, love, children, nature,<br> glory of the Tamil language, and odes to prominent freedom fighters.<br> He fought for<mark> the emancipation of women, against child marriage</mark>,<br> vehemently opposed the caste system, and stood for reforming society and religion.<br>[13][14] His poems were the first to be nationalized in India in<mark> 1949</mark>.<br>[15]

His works include Panjali Sabatham, Kannan Paatu, Kuyil Paatu, Paapa Paatu, Chinnanchriu Kiliye and Vinayagar Nanmanimalai.<br> He also translated Patanjali's Yoga Sutra and Bhagavat Gita to Tamil.<br>[4] Apart from this he also wrote various patriotic songs, religious verses, <br>short stories and translations of speeches of reformist leaders.[8]
